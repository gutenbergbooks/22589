<h1><big>JUBILATION, U.S.A.</big></h1>

<h2>By G. L. VANDENBURG</h2>


<div class="cpoem">You've heard, I'm sure, about the two Martians who went into
a bar, saw a jukebox flashing and glittering, and said to it,
"What's a nice girl like you doing in a joint like this?"
Well, here's one about two Capellans and a slot-machine....</div>


<p class="cap">TORYL pointed the small crypterpreter
toward the wooden,
horseshoe-shaped sign. The
sign's legend was carved in
bright yellow letters. Sartan,
Toryl's companion, watched up
and down the open highway for
signs of life. In seconds the
small cylindrical mechanism completed the
translation.</p>

<p>The sign said:</p>

<div class="sign"><b>JUBILATION, U.S.A.!!</b><br />
<br />
The doggondest, cheeriest<br />
little town in America!</div>

<p>The two aliens smiled at each
other. Unaccustomed to oral
conversation, they exchanged
thoughts.</p>

<p>"<i>The crypterpreter worked incredibly
fast. The language is
quite simple. It would seem safe
to proceed. The sign indicates
friendliness</i>," thought Toryl, the
older of the two Capellans.</p>

<p>"<i>Very well, Brother</i>," replied
Sartan, "<i>though I still worry for
the safety of the ship</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Sartan, our instruments tell
us that anyone who discovers the
ship</i>," Toryl explained, a trifle
impatient, "<i>will show a remarkable
degree of curiosity before
they display any hostility</i>."</p>

<p>Sartan agreed to dismiss his
worries and the two aliens began
to walk along the barren
highway. Before them, at a
great distance, they could see a
cluster of small frame buildings.
When they had walked a hundred
feet or more they encountered
another sign.</p>

<div class="sign"><b>JUBILATION, U.S.A.!!</b><br />
<br />
<b>WELCOME, STRANGER!</b> See America<br />
first and begin with<br />
<b>JUBILATION!</b></div>

<p>And several hundred feet further
two more signs.</p>

<div class="sign"><b>THE ROTARY CLUB</b> of Jubilation<br />
welcomes and extends the warm<br />
hand of friendship to you!!!!<br />
You are now entering Paradise, brother!<br />
<br /><br />
<b>HOWDY, STRANGER! COME RIGHT<br />
ON IN, STAY AWHILE AND MAKE<br />
YOURSELF TO HOME!</b><br />
<br />
&mdash;Jubilation Chamber of<br />
Commerce&mdash;</div>

<p>As members of a peaceful race,
Toryl and Sartan naturally found
the signs encouraging. They
walked at a sprightly pace.</p>

<p>A whirring noise behind them
brought the two to a halt. They
turned to discover a pre-war
Chevy choking its way along the
road. The aliens edged their
way to a gulley along the side of
the road. They were confident of
a friendly reception but, in the
event their calculations had been
wrong, they poised themselves to
make a break in the direction of
their ship.</p>

<p>The ancient Chevy sputtered
by. The driver was almost as ancient
as the car, a bearded fellow
with a stogy stuck between
his teeth and a crushed hat on
his head.</p>

<p>The driver slowed down when
he saw the aliens. "Howdy,
strangers!" he yelled cheerily.
"Say, ain't you fellers a mite
warm in them coveralls?" He
cackled merrily, put his foot to
the floor and sped on by.</p>

<p>Sartan looked at his companion.
"<i>I am sorry, I should not
have doubted you, Brother. You
were right. These people will
welcome our visit. They seem
very cordial.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Good, Sartan. Let us continue.</i>"</p>

<p>One hundred yards further
they were confronted by still another
brace of signs. They stopped
once more.</p>

<div class="sign"><b>CITY LIMITS</b><br />
(Gambling allowed)<br />
<br />
<b>JUBILATION! Where troubles</b><br />
never come due, 'cause the<br />
Good Lord takes a likin' to <b>you</b>!<br />
<br />
Where gloom and doom are outlawed<br />
and there's never any sadness.<br />
<br />
Where a smile lights up the midnight<br />
sky and gives off only gladness!<br />
<br />
(Gambling allowed)</div>

<p>The second sign was another
in the shape of a horseshoe.</p>

<div class="sign"><b>Beyond This Point You Have 4372<br />
Friends You Never Had Before!!!</b><br />
<br />
(Gambling allowed)</div>

<p>Suddenly Toryl stopped and
played with several switches and
dials on the crypterpreter.</p>

<p>"<i>What is wrong, Brother?</i>"
asked the puzzled Sartan.</p>

<p>"<i>I receive no direct translation
for the term 'gambling'.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>What is the closest term the
machine gives?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Fraternizing.</i>"</p>

<p>Sartan laughed. "<i>Now it is you
who fret, Toryl. According to
the signpost legends 'fraternizing'
would seem to be accurate.</i>"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A steady rolling sound of passionless
one-armed bandits
drowned out all other noise in
Okie's Oasis Bar. As a result,
Toryl and Sartan drew little attention
when they entered. Except
for their blue-metallic space
suits they looked like and <i>were</i>
ordinary humans.</p>

<p>They proceeded rather timidly
toward the bar. Okie, the proprietor,
was on duty readying
the place for the night shift.
Toryl held up his hand. The crypterpreter
had already informed
him that oral conversation was
the manner of communication on
the strange planet. Such conversation
had long ago been abandoned
on the planet Capella, but
learned men such as Toryl and
Sartan were familiar with how
it was done, though when they
spoke they sometimes had to
halt between syllables.</p>

<p>"How-dy!" Toryl flashed a
wide grin at the barkeep.</p>

<p>"Just hold your horses there,
mister!" was Okie's sharp reply.
"You ain't the only snake in this
desert. There's four customers
ahead of you!"</p>

<p>Sartan transmitted an admonishing
thought to his companion.
"<i>Toryl, you should have noticed
that the man was busy. He
has only two hands.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Forgive me, Brother, I was
blinded by my own excitement.</i>"</p>

<p>The two Capellans waited and
were soon attracted by the silver-handled
machines that seemed
to have most of the customers
fascinated.</p>

<p>Sartan wandered over to
where a small crowd of men was
gathered around a single machine.
A huge man, raw-boned
and crimson-faced, wearing surplus
army suntans, was operating
the machine.</p>

<p>The big man dropped a large
coin into a slot. He gave the silver
handle a vicious snap. It
made a discordant, bone-crushing
sound. Three little wheels, visible
under glass, spun dizzily.
Anxious, screwed-up faces looked
on as the first little wheel
stopped. <i>Bell Fruit.</i></p>

<p>A collective gasp came from
the small crowd. The second little
wheel stopped. <i>Bell Fruit.</i></p>

<p>Another gasp.</p>

<p>Sartan touched the arm of the
man operating the gambling device.
"I beg your pardon, but
could you please tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The big man wheeled around
like a bear aroused from hibernation.
"Hands off, mister! You
trying to jinx me?"</p>

<p>The third little wheel stopped.
<i>Lemon.</i></p>

<p>The crowd groaned. The big
man turned on Sartan again, a
wild and furious look in his eye.
"You jinxed me! Damn you, I
oughta' bust you one right in the
snout!!"</p>

<p>"My humble apol-o-gies, sir,"
the bewildered Sartan began.</p>

<p>"I'll give you your humble
apologies right back with my
fist," roared the gambler.</p>

<p>Toryl quickly made his way
through the small crowd which
by now was itching to witness a
fight. "Ex-cuse me, sir, but my
friend did not real-ize&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The hell he didn't!" The
gambler fumed. "He was trying
to jinx me, by God! And I'm
gonna teach him to keep his
paws&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Okay, okay, you guys, break
it up!!" It was Okie, massive
and mean looking, using his barrel
belly to push his way through
to the two aliens and the unlucky
gambler. "What's goin' on here,
Smokey?" he inquired of the
gambler.</p>

<p>"Okie, I had a jackpot workin'
when this dumb jerk here ups
and grabs my arm&mdash;"</p>

<p>Toryl interrupted with, "My
friend is sorry for what he did,
sir."</p>

<p>Okie stabbed a cigar into his
mouth. "Who <i>are</i> you guys anyhow?
Where'd you dig up them
crazy coveralls?"</p>

<p>"Sure a queer way to dress in
this heat," spoke a voice from
the crowd.</p>

<p>This was the moment of pride
that Toryl and Sartan had looked
forward to. They both
grinned confident grins. "We
have come to you from Capella,"
he said with some exultation.</p>

<p>Okie's face went blank. "Capella!
Where the hell is that?"</p>

<p>"Sounds like one of them
damn hick towns in California,"
said Smokey, the gambler.</p>

<p>Toryl, somewhat deflated, but
by no means defeated, hastened
to elucidate. "Capella is lo-cat-ed
in the con-stell-a-tion which you
call Auriga."</p>

<p>"Anybody know what the hell
he's talking about?" asked the
annoyed saloonkeeper.</p>

<p>Toryl and Sartan exchanged
troubled glances. Sartan took up
the cudgel. "Auriga is a constellation,
a star cluster, sir. It is
forty-two million light years
away."</p>

<p>"What in tarnation is a light
year?" asked an old-timer in the
group.</p>

<p>Another replied, "They must
be from Alaska. They got light
years up there, sometimes stays
light the whole confounded year
'round."</p>

<p>"That must be it," agreed
Okie, "and that's why they're
wearin' them crazy suits." The
saloonkeeper unloosed a grim
laugh. "You can take them arctic
pajamas off now, boys.
Weather's kinda warm in these
parts!"</p>

<p>"Hey, fellas!" a voice shot
out, "didya bring any Eskimo
babes down with you?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The crowd roared approval at
the witticism.</p>

<p>Toryl transmitted a depressing
thought to his companion. "<i>I
fear they do not believe us, Sartan.</i>"</p>

<p>Sartan did not get the opportunity
to answer immediately.</p>

<p>"Listen, you guys," Okie
pounded his fat finger into Sartan's
chest. "I want you to behave
yourselves, understand?
Now that means lay off the customers
while they're at the
games. You wanna gamble there
is plenty of machines available.
I got a respectable place, I
wanna keep it that way!" He
turned and addressed the other
men. "All right, boys, fun's over!
No fight today! Drink up and
gamble your money away. Let's
get back to the games."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was necessary for Toryl to
use the crypterpreter to translate
the various signs along the
bar. Okie saw the small cylindrical
machine sitting on the bar.
His curiosity bested him. He
gave it a more thorough examination
than a dog gives a fireplug.</p>

<p>Some of the signs read:
"<b>DOUBLE BOURBON&mdash;$2.10</b>" "<b>COOL
GIN RICKEY&mdash;$1.25</b>" "<b>IN GOD WE
TRUST, BUT NOBODY ELSE!</b>" "<b>RUM
COLLINS&mdash;$1</b>" "<b>A FRIEND IN NEED
IS A FRIEND INDEED</b>" "<b>NO INDIANS
SERVED HERE</b>" and "<b>SCOTCH&mdash;IMPORTED,
$1.50&mdash;DOMESTIC,
$1.30</b>."</p>

<p>"Cool gin rick-ey," said Toryl.</p>

<p>"Comin' right up," Okie mumbled,
his attention still wrapped
around the crypterpreter. "Say,
what is this gadget anyway?"</p>

<p>"It is a cryp-terp-reter," Toryl
beamed with pride. "It en-ables
us to un-der-stand and speak
your lan-guage."</p>

<p>"Aw, go on!" Okie managed a
fainthearted grin, uncertain of
whether his leg was being pulled.
"Come on now, tell me what
it is."</p>

<p>"But I have just told you,
sir."</p>

<p>The barkeep cursed under his
breath. "Two gin rickeys, did you
say?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Okie brought the drinks.</p>

<p>Sartan smiled broadly. "Thank
you ex-ceed-ing-ly."</p>

<p>"That'll be two-fifty."</p>

<p>Toryl raised his glass as
though making a toast. "Two-fif-ty!"
he repeated.</p>

<p>Okie caught his arm and
brought the glass down.</p>

<p>"Two-fifty!" the barkeep said
with grim insistence.</p>

<p>Sartan pursed his lips comprehendingly.
He removed a large
pentagonal piece of metal from
his pocket and gave it to Okie.</p>

<p>Okie took the piece between
his fingers, examined it and
frowned. "I give up. What is
it?"</p>

<p>Sartan had to glance at Toryl
for an answer. Toryl threw a
switch on the crypterpreter.</p>

<p>"<i>Money</i>," Toryl silently advised
him.</p>

<p>"Money," said Sartan to Okie.</p>

<p>"You guys hold on and don't
drink up yet," growled the barkeep.
He then yelled in the direction
of the blackjack table.
"Hey, Nugget! Get on over here,
I need you!!"</p>

<p>A wiry little man with a full,
unkempt beard, hustled over to
the bar. "Nugget McDermott at
yer service, Okie! What's yer
pleasure?" he asked with a
sunny smile.</p>

<p>"Take a look at this." Okie
handed him the piece of metal.</p>

<p>The old prospector turned it
over in his hands, bit it and then
held it in his palm as though to
judge its weight. His expert
opinion was, "It's gold, Okie,"
and was uttered without a shred
of modesty.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>The old-timer was highly insulted.
"Am I sure!! Why you
lop-eared, sun-stroked jackass,
of course I'm sure!!! Nugget
McDermott is drawed to gold
like nails to a magnet! Why
when this here town was nothin'
but a patch of cactus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, all right," Okie
waved him off, "don't get your
gander up! Go on back to the
blackjack table and tell Sam to
give you a drink on the house."</p>

<p>"Much obliged, Okie, much
obliged," said Nugget, doffing
his hat and trotting back to the
blackjack table.</p>

<p>The barkeep's face was pure
sunshine when he turned to the
aliens again. "Gentlemen, with
this kind of a substitute you
don't need money in my place.
Drink up!"</p>

<p>"Thank you ex-ceed-ing-ly,"
said Sartan.</p>

<p>Okie arbitrarily judged the
gold piece to be worth ten dollars.
"The management invites
you to try your luck, gentlemen.
Go on give it a whirl."</p>

<p>Toryl and Sartan wore blank
expressions as Okie slapped seven
dollars and fifty cents change
on the bar&mdash;four silver dollars,
four half-dollars and six quarters.</p>

<p>"Don't be bashful, gentlemen.
Okie's machines are friendly to
one and all," said the barkeep.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Toryl removed the change and
gave his companion two silver
dollars, two half-dollars and
three quarters.</p>

<p>"<i>What is the purpose of the
machines?</i>" thought Sartan as
they approached the one-armed
bandits.</p>

<p>"<i>I suppose that is what the
one called Okie wishes us to
learn.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Perhaps it is some type of
registration machine.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>It is doubtful. The gentleman
you disturbed has been at the
same machine since we arrived.</i>"</p>

<p>Sartan gripped the handle of
a vacant machine. "<i>Do you think
it might be a kind of intelligence
test?</i>"</p>

<p>In lieu of an answer Toryl focused
his attention on a small
card, above the machine, which
gave the winning combinations.</p>

<p>"<i>There is that term again.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>What term?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Gambling.</i>" Toryl pointed to
a line on the card warning minors
not to gamble. A look of
perplexity fell upon his face. "<i>I
am no longer sure the term has
anything to do with fraternizing</i>,"
he observed mentally.</p>

<p>"<i>Let us find out.</i>"</p>

<p>Sartan placed a quarter in the
coin slot. The three little wheels
went spinning. Cherry. Lemon.
Lemon.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Toryl and Sartan looked at
each other, their faces blanker
than ever.</p>

<p>"<i>Try it again.</i>"</p>

<p>Sartan disposed of another
quarter. They waited. Lemon.
Plum. Plum.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Toryl inspected the machine
from every angle, like a man on
the outside trying to figure a
way in. "<i>Let me try it.</i>"</p>

<p>He put a quarter in the slot.</p>

<p>Three lemons.</p>

<p>"<i>It isn't very interesting, is
it?</i>" thought Sartan.</p>

<p>"<i>Why don't we try the larger
pieces?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>A splendid idea, Brother.</i>"</p>

<p>The larger coins did not fit.
Toryl proceeded to report this
sad state of affairs to Okie and
was amazed when, for the eight
large coins, Okie rewarded him
with twenty-four smaller ones.
He went back to his companion
at the one-armed bandit.</p>

<p>They then dropped twenty consecutive
quarters into the appropriately
named machine without
getting so much as a single
quarter in return.</p>

<p>"<i>It is puzzling, is it not,
Brother?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Yes, Sartan. From all indications
it would seem to be a machine
totally without purpose.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>It does consume money.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>But why would one build a
machine whose sole purpose is to
consume money?</i>"</p>

<p>Sartan gave it some hard
thought. "<i>I don't know!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Remarkable!</i>" Toryl concluded.
"<i>But nothing is done without
a purpose.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Obviously we've found something
that is.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>No, I do not believe that. Let
me have the electro-analyzer.</i>"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The aliens were so engrossed
in their problem as to be unaware
that Okie and two men at
the bar were casting suspicious
eyes on them.</p>

<p>Sartan fished around in his
pocket and produced a small object
in the shape of an irregular
triangle. Toryl took the electro-analyzer
from him, removed the
cover and moved his finger
around inside. He replaced the
cover and slapped the electro-analyzer
against the side of the
one-armed bandit. When he took
his hand away the small object
stuck to the machine like a leech.</p>

<p>Okie scratched his head and
addressed one of the two men at
the bar. "What the hell you suppose
they're doin', Sam? What's
that gadget for?"</p>

<p>"Search me," replied Sam, a
well dressed, stoop-shouldered
gent, "but if you want my opinion
it doesn't look legal."</p>

<p>"Hey, Nugget!" yelled the
barkeep.</p>

<p>Again the little old prospector
hustled himself over to the bar.</p>

<p>"Nugget McDermott at your
service! What'll it be, Okie?"</p>

<p>"Go on over and get the sheriff.
Tell him there's two queer
characters here trying to jimmy
one of my machines in broad
daylight."</p>

<p>The old man's feet kicked up
sawdust as he scampered out the
door. Okie kept his attention
riveted to the two aliens.</p>

<p>Toryl was busy adjusting the
electro-analyzer to the best possible
position.</p>

<p>"<i>What if it does not respond
to this machine?</i>" Sartan wanted
to know.</p>

<p>"<i>I do not think the machine
contains any type of metal with
which we are unfamiliar. We
will have a reading in one minute.</i>"</p>

<p>The aliens took a step backward
and waited.</p>

<p>A sudden noise, like that of a
television tube exploding, jolted
everyone in the room, including
Toryl and Sartan. The blackjack
table emptied. Gamblers left
their machines. A semi-circle of
the curious formed around the
two aliens. Okie lit out from behind
the bar and elbowed his
way through the crowd.</p>

<p>The aliens' concentration was
unbroken by the attention they
had aroused. With all the single
mindedness of religious fanatics
they continued to observe the
strange mechanical device.</p>

<p>Okie was dumbfounded to find
the machine still in one piece
and doubly dumbfounded to discover
it was behaving in a most
unconventional manner. It was
emitting a low steady gurgling
sound and an occasional sputter
or burp. The legs of the machine
seemed unsteady. Its body shifted
back and forth in herky-jerky
motions like an old-fashioned
washing machine. The three
little Bell Fruit wheels were
spinning at the speed of an airplane
propellor. Okie thought
they might never stop again.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you crazy
galoots doing to my machine!"
he bellowed.</p>

<p>Before the aliens could answer
there was another explosive
sound, causing the crowd to
jump back several steps. Quarters
fell from the mouth of the
machine, slowly at first, then at
an alarming rate. The coins fell,
bounced and rolled all over the
floor. The crowd gulped with
fascination.</p>

<p>"Holy catfish!" said one of the
men, "how long since that blasted
thing's paid off?"</p>

<p>"Looks like this is the first
time," said one of the others.</p>

<p>"You guys keep quiet!" yelled
Okie.</p>

<p>The coins continued to fall for
what seemed like a record time.
The crowd was spellbound. Okie
watched in silent fury.</p>

<p>And the aliens were more confused
than they had been when
the machine <i>wasn't</i> paying off.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The one-armed bandit finally
coughed out its last quarter. The
three Bell Fruit wheels came to
an abrupt halt, as though an inner
spring had snapped. The
machine broke down. Certain observers
later reported that the
poor thing actually <i>looked</i> exhausted.</p>

<p>The sheriff burst in the door
with Nugget McDermott close
behind.</p>

<p>"Sheriff, I want you to arrest
these two tinhorns!" cried Okie.</p>

<p>"Tinhorns??" Sartan's face
was creased with bewilderment.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Okie?" asked
the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Take a look for yourself!
These two bugged my machine
and then broke it down! Look at
that money all over the floor!"</p>

<p>Toryl smiled. "We meant no
harm, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The hell you didn't mean no
harm! You were out to rob
me!"</p>

<p>"We were only ex-per-i-ment-ing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's their crooked experimenting
right there!" said Okie,
pointing a finger at the deactivated
one-armed bandit. "I want
them locked up until that machine's
paid for!"</p>

<p>"All right," said the sheriff,
"you two better come with me."</p>

<p>"But, sir," Sartan protested,
"we merely wanted to know how
the machine functioned. You see,
we are from Capella and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Capella!" exclaimed the sheriff.
"Where is that? I never
heard of the place."</p>

<p>"Well, it is not a part of your
Earth."</p>

<p>"Oh, well why didn't you say
so before!" The sheriff winked
at the crowd. "You mean you
boys are from out of this
world?"</p>

<p>"That is correct," Sartan
grinned proudly.</p>

<p>"Well, well! That makes a big
difference!" The sheriff turned
to the crowd. "All right, boys,
grab them and hustle them over
to the jail house!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A group of men slowly closed
in on the two aliens.</p>

<p>Toryl and Sartan backed away
toward the wall.</p>

<p>"<i>I believe they are angry,
Brother</i>," thought Sartan.</p>

<p>"<i>But why?</i>" inquired Toryl.</p>

<p>"<i>I do not know. Do you suppose
the machine represented
some form of religious deity?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Exceed-ing-ly possible</i>," Toryl
answered.</p>

<p>As the men came closer Okie
yelled, "Just get them two
crackpots! I'll plug the first man
that touches that money!"</p>

<p>The men were diverted by
Okie's warning. They didn't notice,
until it was almost too late,
that the two strangers were halfway
out the door.</p>

<p>"Get after them!!" the sheriff
bellowed.</p>

<p>The aliens ran as though their
lives were at stake, which was
true, following the same route
they had taken into town.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The crowd followed them as
far as the edge of town. From
there they hurled rocks.</p>

<p>Toryl and Sartan continued to
run at breakneck speed, praying
they would reach the safety of
the ship. Once they looked behind
them and saw that the
crowd of angry men had given
up the chase.</p>

<p>Halfway back to their ship
they passed a sign, though they
didn't bother to stop and read it.</p>

<div class="sign"><b>YOU ARE NOW LEAVING<br />
